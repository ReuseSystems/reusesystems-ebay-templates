<!-- Aircraft Parts Terms Tab -->
<div id="content2">
<p><strong>Aircraft parts terms and conditions</strong></p>
<p><br>For spares and repairs. Airworthiness is a legal and technical requirement for any aircraft that operates in the airspace. It means that the aircraft meets the safety standards and regulations established by a competent authority. Only an authority that is certified and recognised by the relevant jurisdiction can determine the airworthiness of an aircraft. Airworthiness has a number of aspects that relate to the legal and physical state of an aircraft. According to ICAO Annex 8, the term airworthy means "The status of an aircraft, engine, propeller or part when it conforms to its approved design and is in a condition for safe operation."</p>
<p><br>In accordance with the Export Control (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2022, the list of military goods, software, and technology subject to strategic export controls in the UK has been updated. This statutory instrument, effective from 3 November 2022, ensures compliance with the UK's international export control commitments. It is incumbent upon the buyer to verify that aircraft and other military parts procured are not dispatched to any of the countries under UK export regulations, which include Afghanistan, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Burma, China, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Georgia, India, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, Libya, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Turkey, Ukraine, Venezuela, and Yemen. Non-compliance with these stipulations constitutes a legal infringement that may result in prosecutorial action or sanctions.</p>
<p><br>Furthermore, buyers are obliged to adhere to any additional export control regulations and restrictions pertinent to the goods or the destination country. These encompass control lists delineating items necessitating an export licence; trade controls governing specific transactions involving the conveyance of controlled items from one nation to another; technology controls restricting the dissemination of information pertaining to controlled items; military end-use controls prohibiting the export of certain commodities potentially utilized for military objectives by specified countries; and sanctions enforcing trade limitations with certain nations or entities under international measures.</p>
